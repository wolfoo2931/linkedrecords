# Attributes

Attributes are the basic building blocks of LinkedRecords. While in a document database, you would
create documents in a collection and in SQL you would create rows in a table, in LinkedRecords you
would create an attribute but it would not belong to a collection nor table. It just exists on its
own. In the most basic form you would retrieve an attribute by its ID. In the facts section you
will see how to query for attributes even if they do not belong to any table or collection.
